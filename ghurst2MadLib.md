There once was a <pig> named Alexandra. She was the tiniest <pig> in the tree. She had always wanted to become a <bird>. 
Alexandra dreamed of having the largest, most colorful <wings> and hoped to <fly> above fields of flowers. She told the <pigs> of her 
dreams however, no one believed in her. All of the other <pig> were twice her size and thought she would only become a tiny 
<wings>. But Alexandra didn’t let what they thought get to her.

She ate only the freshest and greenest leaves while the others laughed at her. And when graduation came and Alexandra <brilliantly> emerged 
from her <house> her dream had come true. The others were astonished. She had the largest and most colorful <wings> of all the <pigs>. 
Her <wings> were like a bird’s <wings>. She had become a queen.
